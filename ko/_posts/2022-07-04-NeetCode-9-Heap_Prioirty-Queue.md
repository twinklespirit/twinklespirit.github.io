\[NeetCode\] - 4. Stack
<!-- outline-end -->


## Problem 1. Valid Parentheses
### 1. Problem
> Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid. <br> An input string is valid if:<br>   1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.<br>   2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

### 2. Example and Constraints
Example 1:<br>
Input: s = "()"<br>
Output: true<br><br>

Example 2:<br>
Input: s = "()[]{}"<br>
Output: true<br><br>

Example 2:<br>
Input: s = "(]"<br>
Output: false<br><br>

Constraints:<br>
* 1 <= s.length <= 104
* s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'

### 3. Solution
First, let me summarize. 
1. when \(, \[, \{ is entered, push them onto the stack and # when이 맞아요? if가 맞아요?
2. when \), \], \} is entered, pop
3. Check that the result matches the mapping table result.
    * (A) mapping table: (is) a dictionary data structure made up of keys and values.
    * We remove the character inserted into the list if it is the same as the key of the table.
    * We will compare the remaining character in the list with the value that correspond to key in the table.
    1. Create the mapping table and
    2. pushes it unconditionally if it does not exist in the table and
    3. returns False if the result does not match when popped.

### 4. Coding in Python3
~~~python
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        # declare a list named "stack" which provides operations available on stack
        stack = [] # storing elements in order (dynamic array)
        # create a function named "mapping table" which compares characters inputed to keys
        mapping_table = {
            ')':'(',
            '}':'{',
            ']':'['
        }

        # loop through the string named "s" by using a for loop
        for bracket in s:
            # if there is no bracket in table(key: '), }, ]')
            if bracket not in table:
                # append brackets in stack
                stack.append(bracket)
            # the bracket is on the table
            # compare bracket to value correspond to key 
            # if not the same
            elif not stack or table[bracket] != stack.pop():
                # return False
                return False
        
        # exception handling: 예를들어 '['가 입력될 때도 true를 출력해 줘야 함
        return len(stack) == 0 # Return True if the stack length is 0
~~~

### 5. Big O 
* Time Complexity
    * Stack operations .push() and .pop() operate on O(1)
    * loop through all elements of the list O(n)
    (the time complexity of this problem is O(n))  
* Space Complexity
    * store all the elements of the list O(n)

## Problem 2. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (Medium)

## Problem 3. Longest Repeating Character Replacement (Medium)
### 1. Problem
> There are n cars going to the same destination along a one-lane road. The destination is target miles away. <br>
> You are given two integer array position and speed, both of length n, where position[i] is the position of the ith car and speed[i] is the speed of the ith car (in miles per hour). <br>
> A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to it and drive bumper to bumper at the same speed. The faster car will slow down to match the slower car's speed. The distance between these two cars is ignored (i.e., they are assumed to have the same position). <br>
> A car fleet is some non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same speed. Note that a single car is also a car fleet. <br>
> If a car catches up to a car fleet right at the destination point, it will still be considered as one car fleet. <br>
> Return the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination.

### 2. Example and Constraints
Example 1:<br>
Input: target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]<br>
Output: 3<br>
Explanation:
The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12.
The car starting at 0 does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.
The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.
Note that no other cars meet these fleets before the destination, so the answer is 3.<br><br>

Example 2:<br>
Input: target = 10, position = [3], speed = [3]<br>
Output: 1<br>
Explanation: There is only one car, hence there is only one fleet.<br><br>

Example 3:<br>
Input: target = 100, position = [0,2,4], speed = [4,2,1]<br>
Output: 1<br>
Explanation:
The cars starting at 0 (speed 4) and 2 (speed 2) become a fleet, meeting each other at 4. The fleet moves at speed 2.
Then, the fleet (speed 2) and the car starting at 4 (speed 1) become one fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.<br><br>

Constraints:
* n == position.length == speed.length
* 1 <= n <= 105
* 0 < target <= 106
* 0 <= position[i] < target
* All the values of position are unique.
* 0 < speed[i] <= 106

### 3. Solution
1. 자동차의 위치를 정렬 (named cars)
2. 자동차의 위치에서 목적지까지 가는 **시간**을 구한다. (시간=거리/속력)
3. cars 위치가 [5,3]-> (X), [3,3]-> (O) 따라 잡을 순 없고 같이 갈 순 있음
4. 

### 4. Coding in Python3
~~~python
class Solution:
    def carFleet(self, target: int, position: List[int], speed: List[int]) -> int:
        # (1) zip
        # (2) sorted by position
        cars = sorted(zip(position, speed))
        # time = distance/speed
        times = [(target-p)/s for p, s in cars]
        # 전부다 똑같이 들어올 경우
        fleet = 1
        # stack 연산을 이용하여 마지막 요소를 하나씩 제거하며 비교
        while len(times) > 1:
            lead = times.pop()
            if lead < times[-1]:
                fleet += 1
            else:
                times[-1] = lead
        return fleet
~~~
